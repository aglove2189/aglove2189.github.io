                    <li>Developed a novel model fitting solution for determining a well's spontaneous (SP) log curve using peak detection methods and Kalman filters. The end result was used by the geophysicist team to identify potential oil field plays to target or acquire.</li>
                    <li>Developed a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) solution for simulating a well's decline curve and ultimate recovery. This augmented engineering's decision making on how much a well will produce over its lifetime and optimized field development and planning.</li>
                    <li>Optimized an in house developed geophysics simulator in Python which decreased runtime by 6x and lines of code were reduced 10x.</li>
                    <li>Contributed to the development of a multi model prediction framework for predicting well production. The solution was a significant improvement on the industry standard decline curve fitting.</li>
                    <li>Implemented a real time alert for detecting tubing leaks which resulted in a cost savings in the six figures. An industry standard deterministic model was required by Engineering, the model was optimized by sampling the search space with a Tree-structured Parzen Estimator.</li>
